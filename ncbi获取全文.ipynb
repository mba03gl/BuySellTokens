            "标题: A genome-wide association study of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in Samoan women.\n",
            "摘要: STUDY QUESTION: Can a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) help identify genetic variation or genes associated with circulating anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in Samoan women? SUMMARY ANSWER: We identified eleven genome-wide suggestive loci (strongest association signal in ARID3A 19-946163-G-C [ p = 2.32 x 10(-)(7)]) and seven transcriptome-wide significant genes ( GINS2, SENP3, USP7, TUSC3, MAFA, METTL4, NDFIP1 [all with a p < 2.50 x 10(-)(6)]) associated with circulating AMH levels in Samoan women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Three prior GWASs of AMH levels identified eight loci in premenopausal women of European ancestry (AMH, MCM8, TEX41 , CHECK2, CDCA7 , EIF4EBP1, BMP4 and an uncharacterized non-coding RNA gene CTB-99A3.1 ), among which the MCM8 locus was shared among all three studies. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: We included a sample of 1,185 women from two independently recruited samples: a family study ( n = 212; [age: 18 to 40 years]) recruited in 2002-03 from Samoa and American Samoa; and the Soifua Manuia Study ( n = 973; age: 25 to 51 years), a crosssectional population-based study recruited in 2010 from Samoa. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Serum AMH levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We performed GWASs in the two participant samples using a Cox mixed-effects model to account for AMH levels below detectable limits and adjusted for centered age, centered age(2), polity, and kinship via kinship matrix. The summary statistics were then meta-analyzed using a fixed-effect model. We annotated the variants with p < 1 x 10(-)(5) and calculated posterior probability of causality for prioritization. We further annotated variants using FUMA and performed colocalization and transcriptome-wide association analysis. We also assessed whether any previously reported loci were replicated in our GWAS. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We identified eleven novel genome-wide suggestive loci ( p < 1 x 10(-)(5)) associated with AMH levels and replicated EIF4EBP1, a previously reported AMH locus, in the GWAS. The lead variant in ARID3A , 19-946163-G-C is in high linkage disequilibrium ( r (2) = 0.79) with the known age-at-menopause variant 19-950694-G-A. Nearby KISS1R is a biologically plausibility causal gene in the region; kisspeptin regulates ovarian follicle development and has been linked to AMH levels. Further investigation of the ARID3A locus is warranted. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitations of our study are the small sample size for a GWAS and the use of the transcription model trained on mostly European samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which may have led to reduced power to detect genotype-expression associations. Our findings need to be validated in larger Polynesian cohorts. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In addition to replicating one of the eight previously discovered AMH loci, we identified new suggestive associations. It is known that the inclusion of founder populations aids in the discovery of novel loci. These findings could enhance our understanding of AMH and AMH-related reproductive phenotypes (ovarian reserve, age at menopause, premature ovarian failure, and polycystic ovary syndrome) and help build a screening approach for women at risk for these phenotypes using genetically predicted AMH levels. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This work was funded by NIH grants R01-HL093093 (PI: S.T.M.), R01-HL133040 (PI: R.L.M.), and T90-DE030853 (PI: C.S. Sfeir).

            "标题: Whole-exome sequencing and Drosophila modelling reveal mutated genes and pathways contributing to human ovarian failure.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Ovarian failure (OF) is a multifactorial, complex disease presented by up to 1% of women under 40 years of age. Despite 90% of patients being diagnosed with idiopathic OF, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown, making it difficult to personalize treatments for these patients in the clinical setting. Studying the presence and/or accumulation of SNVs at the gene/pathway levels will help describe novel genes and characterize disrupted biological pathways linked with ovarian failure. METHODS: Ad-hoc case-control SNV screening conducted from 2020 to 2023 of 150 VCF files WES data included Spanish IVF patients with (n = 118) and without (n = 32) OF (< 40 years of age; mean BMI 22.78) along with GnomAD (n = 38,947) and IGSR (n = 1,271; 258 European female VCF) data for pseudo-control female populations. SNVs were prioritized according to their predicted deleteriousness, frequency in genomic databases, and proportional differences across populations. A burden test was performed to reveal genes with a higher presence of SNVs in the OF cohort in comparison to control and pseudo-control groups. Systematic in-silico analyses were performed to assess the potential disruptions caused by the mutated genes in relevant biological pathways. Finally, genes with orthologues in Drosophila melanogaster were considered to experimentally validate the potential impediments to ovarian function and reproductive potential. RESULTS: Eighteen genes had a higher presence of SNVs in the OF population (FDR < 0.05). AK2, CDC27, CFTR, CTBP2, KMT2C, and MTCH2 were associated with OF for the first time and their silenced/knockout forms reduced fertility in Drosophila. We also predicted the disruption of 29 sub-pathways across four signalling pathways (FDR < 0.05). These sub-pathways included the metaphase to anaphase transition during oocyte meiosis, inflammatory processes related to necroptosis, DNA repair mismatch systems and the MAPK signalling cascade. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the underlying molecular mechanisms of OF, providing novel associations for six genes and OF-related infertility, setting a foundation for further biomarker development, and improving precision medicine in infertility.\n",

            "标题: Searching for the 'X' factor: investigating the genetics of primary ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is the cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40. The causes of POI are heterogeneous, but substantial evidence exists to support a genetic basis of POI, particularly in the critical involvement of genes on the X chromosome. Recent studies have revealed novel candidate genes through the identification of copy number variations associated with POI. This review summarizes the genes located on the X chromosome with variants shown to be associated with POI in humans and/or in mice. Additionally, we present evidence to support the potential involvement of these candidate genes in the etiology of POI. We conducted a literature search in PubMed to identify case studies and screenings for the genetic causes of POI. We then performed systematic searches for the proposed candidate genes to investigate their potential reproductive roles. Of the X-linked candidate genes investigated, 10 were found to have variants associated with cases of POI in humans. An additional 10 genes were found to play a supportive role in POI. Other genes were not implicated in any cases of POI but were associated with various roles in reproduction. In the majority of cases where variants were identified through whole-exome sequencing, rather than targeted screening of candidate genes, more than one genetic variant was identified. Overall, this review supports past findings that the X chromosome plays a critical role in ovarian function, as demonstrated by a link between POI and various disruptions to genes on the X chromosome. Current genetic screening for POI, which includes only FMR1, is inadequate to capture the majority of cases with a genetic origin. An expanded genetic testing may improve health outcomes for individuals with POI as it could lead to better early interventions and education about these health risks.\n",

            "标题: Investigation of an MCM8 gene variant in women with premature ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: INTRODUCTION: The MCM8 gene is involved in the homologous recombination and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. It maintains the meiotic process continuously. If the MCM8-9 helicase does not function, the accumulation of DNA breaks can result in cell death. Studies have reported MCM8 gene suppression with primary ovarian insufficiency. In the present study, a variant of the MCM8 gene was investigated in women with primary ovarian insufficiency to elucidate the role of MCM8 in this pathology. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of the NG_042869.1:g.40270G>A variant of the MCM8 gene in the study population. METHODS: The MCM8 gene variant was analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reaction using a hydrolysis probe in DNA samples from women diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency, with a normal karyotype and without FMR1 gene permutation, and from a Control Group, who had menopause after 50 years of age. Frequencies were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 100 samples from the Case Group and 100 samples from the Control Group were selected. The variant was detected in heterozygosity in a Case Group sample but was not identified in the Control Group. DISCUSSION: This variant was first described in a consanguineous Arab family. This variant is classified as pathogenic and has a prevalence of 1% in women with primary ovarian insufficiency. This study is a pioneering investigation of this variant in Brazilian women. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the rs138761187 variant of the MCM8 gene is rare in Brazilian women.\n",

            "标题: Biallelic Germline BRCA1 Frameshift Mutations Associated with Isolated Diminished Ovarian Reserve.\n",
            "摘要: The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently enabled the discovery of genetic causes of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) with high genetic heterogeneity. In contrast, the causes of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) remain poorly understood. Here, we identified by NGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) the cause of isolated DOR in a 14-year-old patient. Two frameshift mutations in BRCA1 (NM_007294.4) were found: in exon 8 (c.470_471del; p.Ser157Ter) and in exon 11 (c.791_794del, p.Ser264MetfsTer33). Unexpectedly, the patient presented no signs of Fanconi anemia (FA), i.e., no developmental abnormalities or indications of bone marrow failure. However, high chromosomal fragility was found in the patient's cells, consistent with an FA diagnosis. RT-PCR and Western-blot analysis support the fact that the c. 791_794del BRCA1 allele is transcribed and translated into a shorter protein (del11q), while no expression of the full-length BRCA1 protein was found. DNA damage response (DDR) studies after genotoxic agents demonstrate normal activation of the early stages of the DDR and FANC/BRCA pathway. This is consistent with the maintenance of residual repair activity for the del11q BRCA1 isoform. Our observation is the first implication of bi-allelic BRCA1 mutations in isolated ovarian dysfunction or infertility in humans, without clinical signs of FA, and highlights the importance of BRCA1 in ovarian development and function.\n",

            "标题: Multi-locus high-risk alleles association from interleukin's genes with female infertility and certain comorbidities.\n",
            "摘要: Objective There is evidence that cytokine genes' single nucleotide polymorphisms could be the reasons behind female infertility. This study aimed to identify the role for Interleukin33 rs1048274 (G > A) and rs16924243 (T > C), Interleukin22 rs1397852121 (C > T), rs1295978671 (C > T) and rs2227483 (A > T), Interleukin17A rs2275913 (G > A,C) and Interleukin17F rs763780 (T > C), Interleukin13 1512 (A > C) and IL13 2044 (G > A), and Interleukin4 rs2243250 (C > T) and rs2070874 (C > T) gene polymorphisms in female infertility to gain a richly more detailed understanding of its genetic predisposition. Five distinct groups, each comprising 200 infertile women and 200 age-matched fertile controls, were recruited to each Interleukins (33, 22, 17, 13 and 4) in this case-control study and were genotyped by using an amplification refractory mutation system. Statistical analysis is conducted by SPSS software V. 22 and using Chi-square (chi(2)) and logistic regression tests. Strength of association was estimated by multiple-comparison correction, population structure test and Haplotype analysis. The study was approved by the Academic Ethics Committee and each enrolled patient signed an informed consent.Results Our statistical results revealed risk alleles in all of the substitution lines for women infertility. Current findings provided evidence that in the presence of Interleukin33 A(p-value rs1048274 = 0.002) and C(p-value rs16924243 <) (0.0001), Interleukin 22T(p-value rs1397852121 < 0.0001) and T(p-value rs2227483 = 0.000), Interleukin17A A(p-value rs2275913 = 0.003) and Interleukin17F C(p-value rs763780 = 0.000) and Interleukin13 C(p-value 1512 = 0.000) and A(p-value 2044 = 0.003), Interleukin4 T(p-value rs2243250 = 0.001) and T(p-value rs2070874 = 0.009) risk alleles, risk genotype also were significantly associated with increased chances of developing infertility. The relationship between risk genotypes and several well-established infertility risk factors including, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, oophorectomy, diminished ovarian reserve, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, uterine polyps, fallopian tube blockage and thyroid dysfunction, also exhibited. This study suggests the significant role of interleukin gene polymorphisms in human reproductive success.\n",

            "标题: Relevant propositions for Y chromosome interpretation.\n",
            "摘要: The Y chromosomal haplotype is expected to be identical (or close to, depending on the mutation rate) among a male and many of his paternal relatives. This means that often the same evidential value for the DNA evidence is obtained, whether the true donor or one of his close paternal relatives is compared to a crime sample. Commentators (see for example the UK Forensic Science Regulator or Amorim) have suggested to change the proposition pair to compare the probability of the evidence if the Person of Interest (POI) or one of his close paternal relatives left the DNA to the probability of the evidence if an unrelated male from the population left the DNA. We argue that this is problematic because there is no clear definition of close paternal relatives and truly unrelated males do not exist. Instead, we take a starting point in the traditional proposition pair \"The source of the male DNA is the POI\" versus \"The source of the male DNA is not the POI\" and make the latter one operational by suggesting that it is formulated as \"The source of the male DNA is a random man from the population\". The issue of matching males in the POI's lineage is then addressed either in a comment in the statement or directly through a probability model.\n",

            "标题: MGA loss-of-function variants cause premature ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Although premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a common cause of female infertility and subfertility, has a well-established hereditary component, the genetic factors currently implicated in POI account for only a limited proportion of cases. Here, using an exome-wide, gene-based case-control analysis in a discovery cohort comprising 1,027 POI cases and 2,733 ethnically matched women controls from China, we found that heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants of MAX dimerization protein (MGA) were significantly enriched in the discovery cohort, accounting for 2.6% of POI cases, while no MGA LoF variants were found in the matched control females. Further exome screening was conducted in 4 additional POI cohorts (2 from China and 2 from the United States) for replication studies, and we identified heterozygous MGA LoF variants in 1.0%, 1.4%, 1.0%, and 1.0% of POI cases, respectively. Overall, a total of 37 distinct heterozygous MGA LoF variants were discovered in 38 POI cases, accounting for approximately 2.0% of the total 1,910 POI cases analyzed in this study. Accordingly, Mga+/- female mice were subfertile, exhibiting shorter reproductive lifespan and decreased follicle number compared with WT, mimicking the observed phenotype in humans. Our findings highlight the essential role of MGA deficiency for impaired female reproductive ability.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Genetic mutations have been reported in a number of bone disorders with or without extra-skeletal manifestations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the genetic cause in a middle-aged woman with osteoporosis, recurrent fractures and extraskeletal manifestations. METHODS: A 56-year-old Indian woman presented to the clinic with complaints of difficulty in walking, recurrent fractures, limb bending, progressive skeletal deformities, and poor overall health. At the age of 37, she had experienced severe anemia with diarrhea, significant weight loss, knuckle pigmentation, and a significant loss of scalp hair. She had received multiple blood transfusions and parenteral iron supplementation with normalization of hemoglobin. Subsequently, she had premature menopause at the age of 37. She died at the age of 61 due to liver failure. Exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing were undertaken to identify the potential pathogenic mutations. RESULTS: Genetic investigation identified likely pathogenic mutations in the LRP5 and LGR4 genes. Out of the two mutations, the heterozygous mutation (c.1199C>T) in the LRP5 gene resulted in a non-synonymous substitution of alanine with valine at the 400(th) position, and the second mutation (c.1403A>C) in the LGR4 gene led to a non-synonymous substitution of tyrosine with serine at the 468(th) residue of the protein. The minor allele frequencies of the c.1199C>T (LRP5) substitution in the 1000 genomes and IndiGenomes databases are 0.0003 and 0.001, while the c.1403A>C (LGR4) substitution has not been reported in these databases. Various in silico prediction tools suggested LGR4 mutation to be pathogenic and LRP5 mutation to be likely pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous mutations in the LRP5 and LGR4 genes had additive deteriorative effects on BMD, resulting in recurrent fractures and bone deformities, and extended the effect to extraskeletal sites, contributing to the poor overall health in this patient.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Premature menopause (PM) is defined as the end of ovulation before the age of 40 years, a condition commonly referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency. It has been shown there is an association between early menopause and a high risk of cardiovascular disease. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphisms related to premature menopause on cardio-metabolic disorders Objective: We aimed to investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with PM and the risk of cardio-metabolic disorders in the MASHAD cohort study. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 117 women with PM were recruited and compared with 183 healthy women. All participants were assessed for anthropometric indices and genotyped for eight selected polymorphisms within seven different genes. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in physical activity level (PAL) between the groups. Individuals with rs4806660 CC genotype had a 3.63-fold increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, individuals with a TT genotype of the rs2303369 polymorphism had a 3.11-- fold increased risk of obesity. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that genetic variations are risk factors related to cardio- metabolic disorders in women with premature menopause.\n",

            "标题: Identification and Characterization of Novel FSHR Copy Number Variations Causing Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a key pituitary gonadotropic hormone implicated in human fertility and is crucial for folliculogenesis and recruitment of new antral follicles. Variations in its receptor, FSHR, can lead to diverse reproductive phenotypes including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). This study reports a novel case of FSHR-related ovarian insufficiency in a patient with primary amenorrhea, subnormal AMH levels, and delayed puberty. Genetic exploration revealed two compound heterozygous intragenic deletions of FSHR. Specifically, the patient inherited a maternally derived deletion spanning exons 5-10 and a paternally derived deletion involving exons 3-6. Through chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), exome sequencing, long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing, we characterized the breakpoints and confirmed the compound heterozygous deletions. The findings reveal a complete loss of function of both FSHR alleles, contributing to the patient's POI phenotype. This case emphasizes the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in FSHR-related disorders and the role of CNVs in POI phenotypes. Although these events are rare, our results advocate for the inclusion of CNV detection in the diagnostic workup of POI to ensure accurate diagnosis and better patient management.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is one of the leading causes of female infertility. To date, the genetic etiology of POI has been elucidated in approximately 20-25% of the total cases. The human zona pellucida (ZP) plays an important role in the organization and differentiation of granulosa cells, follicle formation, and sperm recognition. Mutations in ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 have been reported to cause female infertility due to oocyte degeneration, empty follicle, or in vitro fertilization failure. In this study, we identified three novel missense mutations in ZP3 (NM_001110354.2): c.643G > A (p.Asp215Asn), c.215 C > T (p.Thr72Ile), and c.152T > C (p.Leu51Pro) in three sporadic Han Chinese POI patients through whole-exome sequencing. These variants are absent from population databases and were predicted to be deleterious by multiple in silico tools. Structure prediction analysis showed that the affected amino acid altered the ZP3 protein structure. Western blot further confirmed that these ZP3 variants reduced the expression and secretion of ZP components. In summary, this study reports three novel deleterious variants in ZP3 associated with POI, thereby broadening the mutation spectrum of ZP3 in POI patients.\n",

            "摘要: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: AARS2-related disorder includes two distinct phenotypes, infantile-onset cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy. AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy is characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, skeletal myopathy, and often lung hypoplasia. Some individuals have nonimmune hydrops and/or seizures. AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy is characterized by movement disorders, cognitive decline, ovarian failure in females, and psychiatric manifestations. Additional neurologic manifestations (seizures, developmental delay, neuropathy, and/or myopathy) and ocular manifestations can also be present. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of AARS2-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in AARS2 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: In AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy, standard treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, and seizures; feeding therapy with tube feedings as required. In AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy, levodopa or other dopaminergic therapies for parkinsonism; botulinum toxin for spasticity; additional management of motor dysfunction per orthopedist, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist; cognitive behavioral therapy; psychoeducational interventions; treatment of hypogonadism in females per endocrinologist and/or gynecologist; psychotherapy and neuropsychological rehabilitation for neuropsychiatric manifestations; standard treatments for ocular manifestations and seizures. Surveillance: In AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy, cardiology evaluation including EKG and echocardiogram with frequency per cardiologist; assessment of growth and feeding at each visit; assessment of respiratory function as needed; neurologic evaluation, brain MRI, and EEG as needed. In AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy, neurologic assessment for movement disorders, changes in tone, and seizures every six months or as needed; assessment of mobility and self-help skills at each visit; assessment of cognitive function every six to 12 months; assessment for features of premature ovarian failure with frequency per endocrinologist and/or gynecologist; psychiatric assessment every six to 12 months; ophthalmology evaluation with frequency per ophthalmologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sedatives, antipsychotics, and other medications that may decrease alertness and increase the risk of falling should be used cautiously. GENETIC COUNSELING: AARS2-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an AARS2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the AARS2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterised by the loss or complete absence of ovarian activity in women under the age of 40. Clinical presentation of POI varies with phenotypic severity ranging from premature loss of menses to complete gonadal dysgenesis. POI is genetically heterogeneous with >100 causative gene variants identified thus far. The aetiology of POI varies from syndromic, idiopathic, monogenic to autoimmune causes the condition. Genetic diagnoses are beneficial to those impacted by POI as it allows for improved clinical management and fertility preservation. Identifying novel variants in candidate POI genes, however, is insufficient to make clinical diagnoses. The impact of missense variants can be predicted using bioinformatic algorithms but computational approaches have limitations and can generate false positive and false negative predictions. Functional characterisation of missense variants, is therefore imperative, particularly for genes lacking a well-established genotype:phenotype correlation. Here we used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the first case of a homozygous missense variant in DIS3 (c.2320C > T; p.His774Tyr) a critical component of the RNA exosome in a POI patient. This adds to the previously described compound heterozygous patient. We perform the first functional characterisation of a human POI-associated DIS3 variant. A slight defect in mitotic growth was caused by the variant in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Transgenic rescue of Dis3 knockdown in Drosophila melanogaster with human DIS3 carrying the patient variant led to aberrant ovarian development and egg chamber degeneration. This supports a potential deleterious impact of the human c.2320C > T; p.His774Tyr variant.\n",

            "标题: Population-based FMR1 carrier screening among reproductive women.\n",
            "摘要: PURPOSE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by an CGG repeat expansion (FM, > 200 CGG) in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. Female carriers of a premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG) can transmit the PM allele, which, depending on the CGG allele size, can expand to an allele in the FM range in the offspring. METHODS: Carrier screening for FMR1 PM is not available in Thailand. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PM carriers among Thai reproductive women at the tertiary hospital. A total of 1250 females participated in this study; ages ranged from 20 to 45 years, mean of 30 years (S.D. = 6.27). RESULTS: Two carriers of a premutation allele, with 32,62 and 32,69 CGG repeats respectively, were identified. This corresponds to 1 in 600 women or 0.17% of the population. Further, three women carrying a gray zone allele (45-54 CGG repeats) were identified (29,51; 29,49; and 30,47 CGG repeats) which equals to 1:400 women or 0.25% of the population. No FM case was detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study heightens the importance of PM carrier screening of women of reproductive age, particularly for the higher risk of developing fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Early identification of PM carrier status enhances family planning and fecundity alternatives and improves reproductive health outcomes leading to a better life.\n",

            "标题: Oocytes maintain low ROS levels to support the dormancy of primordial follicles.\n",
            "摘要: Primordial follicles (PFs) function as the long-term reserve for female reproduction, remaining dormant in the ovaries and becoming progressively depleted with age. Oxidative stress plays an important role in promoting female reproductive senescence during aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we find that low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for sustaining PF dormancy. Compared to growing follicles, oocytes within PFs were shown to be more susceptible to ROS, which accumulates and damages PFs to promote reproductive senescence. Mechanistically, oocytes within PFs were shown to express high levels of the intracellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), counteracting ROS accumulation. Decreased SOD1 expression, as a result of aging or through the experimental deletion of the Sod1 gene in oocytes, resulted in increased oxidative stress and triggered ferroptosis within PFs. In conclusion, this study identified antioxidant defense mechanisms protecting PFs in mouse ovaries and characterized cell death mechanisms of oxidative stress-induced PF death.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is the main cause of infertility in women. Some cases of POI are thought to be caused by genetic defects and the clinical outcomes of these patients are unknown. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of the peripheral blood of a cohort of 55 subjects with POI and identified one heterozygous missense variant in FOXL2 (c.1045G>C; p.Arg349Gly) and two heterozygous missense variants in ERCC6 (c.379G>A; p.Val127Ile and c.4223A>C; p.Glu1408 Ala) in four POI patients. All of these heterozygous mutations were predicted to be deleterious and were parentally inherited from their heterozygous fathers. The mRNA and protein expression of FOXL2 and ERCC6 were absent or decreased in the patients. The patients carrying the variants of FOXL2 (c.1045G>C; p.Arg349Gly) and ERCC6 (c.379G>A; p.Val127Ile) failed to conceive in two and four assisted reproductive cycles, respectively. Another patient and her sister carrying the ERCC6 (c.4223A>C; p.Glu1408 Ala) variant achieved good clinical outcomes after assisted reproductive therapy. Our findings support the possible roles of FOXL2 and ERCC6 in POI and might contribute to the genetic counseling of POI patients.\n",

            "摘要: The relationship between premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and premutation in the FMR1 gene is well established. In recent years, though, a potential relationship between the latter and a low ovarian reserve has been suggested. To explore it, we conducted a retrospective study in an IVF program at a university tertiary referral center in Barcelona (Spain). Data were obtained retrospectively from a total of 385 women referred for FMR1 gene testing at our institution from January 2018 to December 2021. We compared the prevalence of FMR1 gene premutation between 93 of them, younger than 35 years, with a diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), characterized by levels of anti-Mullerian hormone < 1.1 ng/mL and antral follicle count < 5; and 132 egg donors screened by protocol that served as the controls. We found a higher prevalence of FMR1 premutation in the DOR group (seven patients (7.69%)) than in the control group (one patient (1.32%)), Fisher-exact test p-value = 0.012). We concluded that compared with the general population represented by young egg donors, the prevalence of FMR1 gene premutation is higher in young patients with a diminished ovarian reserve. Although these findings warrant further prospective validation in a larger cohort of patients within DOR, they suggest that, in clinical practice, FMR1 premutation should be determined in infertile young patients with DOR in order to give them adequate genetic counselling.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as the depletion of ovarian function before the age of 40 years. The global prevalence of POI is 3.5%. To date, genetic factors account for 23.5% of the etiology of POI. Herein, a previously uncharacterized pathogenic homozygous variant of the chromosome segregation-1-like gene (CSE1L) was identified in POI patients via targeted panel sequencing. It is reported that dysregulated iron metabolism is involved in many reproductive endocrine disorders; however, its precise role in POI remains obscure. In this study, we identified CSE1L as a potential candidate gene that plays an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis. Deficiency of CSE1L led to ferroptosis in human granulosa cells, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Mechanistically, coimmunoprecipitation identified the direct interaction between CSE1L and FoxO1. Inhibition of CSE1L led to the excessive accumulation of FoxO1 in the nucleus via nucleocytoplasmic transport. Then, FoxO1 bound to the promoter region of NCOA4 and promoted its transcription, which was verified by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, inhibition of CSE1L in cumulus cell monolayer could impede oocyte maturation, which might be associated with oxidative stress. Consequently, our study first revealed that CSE1L participated in ferroptosis in human ovarian granulosa cells via nucleocytoplasmic transportation, which might be helpful in revealing the molecular mechanism of CSE1L in the development of POI. Importantly, these findings might provide new insights into the application of ferroptosis inhibitors in the treatment of POI.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND/AIM: The tumor suppressor CDKN2C (also designed as p18(INK4C) or p18) is deleted in approximately 7% to 40% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, indicative of its potential association with myeloma pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quantitative real-time PCR-based assay was developed to determine p18 deletion in DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a cohort of 108 multiple myeloma patients after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Additionally, the p18 mRNA expression level in PBMCs was quantitatively assessed using Taqman((R)) gene expression assays. RESULTS: p18 was homozygously and hemizygously deleted in PBMCs from 3 (2.8%) and 5 (4.6%) patients, respectively. Neither the p18 deletion nor the p18 mRNA levels in PBMCs were associated with progression-free survival (PFS), 90-day response, and the occurrence of severe mucositis in these patients (all p-values >0.20). CONCLUSION: Neither p18 deletion nor p18 mRNA expression in PBMCs can be used as a prognostic biomarker in MM patients.\n",

            "摘要: Age at menopause (AOM) has a substantial impact on fertility and disease risk. While many loci with variants that associate with AOM have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) under an additive model, other genetic models are rarely considered(1). Here through GWAS meta-analysis under the recessive model of 174,329 postmenopausal women from Iceland, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK; UK Biobank) and Norway, we study low-frequency variants with a large effect on AOM. We discovered that women homozygous for the stop-gain variant rs117316434 (A) in CCDC201 (p.(Arg162Ter), minor allele frequency ~1%) reached menopause 9 years earlier than other women (P = 1.3 x 10(-15)). The genotype is present in one in 10,000 northern European women and leads to primary ovarian insufficiency in close to half of them. Consequently, homozygotes have fewer children, and the age at last childbirth is 5 years earlier (P = 3.8 x 10(-5)). The CCDC201 gene was only found in humans in 2022 and is highly expressed in oocytes. Homozygosity for CCDC201 loss-of-function has a substantial impact on female reproductive health, and homozygotes would benefit from reproductive counseling and treatment for symptoms of early menopause.\n",

            "标题: Oocyte-specific deletion of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 causes apoptosis of mouse oocytes within the early-growing follicles by mitochondrial fission defect-reactive oxygen species-DNA damage.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Mutations in several translation initiation factors are closely associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), but the underlying pathogenesis remains largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (Eif5) conditional knockout mice aiming to investigate the function of eIF5 during oocyte growth and follicle development. Here, we demonstrated that Eif5 deletion in mouse primordial and growing oocytes both resulted in the apoptosis of oocytes within the early-growing follicles. Further studies revealed that Eif5 deletion in oocytes downregulated the levels of mitochondrial fission-related proteins (p-DRP1, FIS1, MFF and MTFR) and upregulated the levels of the integrated stress response-related proteins (AARS1, SHMT2 and SLC7A1) and genes (Atf4, Ddit3 and Fgf21). Consistent with this, Eif5 deletion in oocytes resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by elongated form, aggregated distribution beneath the oocyte membrane, decreased adenosine triphosphate content and mtDNA copy numbers, and excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Meanwhile, Eif5 deletion in oocytes led to a significant increase in the levels of DNA damage response proteins (gammaH2AX, p-CHK2 and p-p53) and proapoptotic proteins (PUMA and BAX), as well as a significant decrease in the levels of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Eif5 deletion in mouse oocytes results in the apoptosis of oocytes within the early-growing follicles via mitochondrial fission defects, excessive ROS accumulation and DNA damage. This study provides new insights into pathogenesis, genetic diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets for POI. KEY POINTS: Eif5 deletion in oocytes leads to arrest in oocyte growth and follicle development. Eif5 deletion in oocytes impairs the translation of mitochondrial fission-related proteins, followed by mitochondrial dysfunction. Depletion of Eif5 causes oocyte apoptosis via ROS accumulation and DNA damage response pathway.\n",

            "摘要: Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) is a highly heterogeneous condition characterized by ovarian dysfunction in women occurring before the age of 40, representing a significant cause of female infertility. It manifests through primary or secondary amenorrhea. While more than half of POI cases are idiopathic, genetic factors play a pivotal role in all instances with known causes, contributing to approximately 20-25% of cases. This article comprehensively reviews the genetic factors associated with POI, delineating the primary candidate genes. The discussion delves into the intricate relationship between these genes and ovarian development, elucidating the functional consequences of diverse mutations to underscore the fundamental impact of genetic effects on POI. The identified genetic factors, encompassing gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, are systematically classified based on whether the resulting POI is syndromic or non-syndromic. Furthermore, this paper explores the genetic interplay between mitochondrial genes, such as Required for Meiotic Nuclear Division 1 homolog Gene (RMND1), Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S22 Gene (MRPS22), Leucine-rich Pentapeptide Repeat Gene (LRPPRC), and non-coding RNAs, including both microRNAs and Long non-coding RNAs, with POI. The insights provided serve to consolidate and enhance our understanding of the etiology of POI, contributing to establishing a theoretical foundation for diagnosing and treating POI patients, as well as for exploring the mechanisms underlying the disease.\n",

            "标题: Conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes causes reduced litter size, ovarian reserve depletion and impaired oocyte in vitro maturation with advanced reproductive age in mice.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: An estimated 1 in 350 women carry germline BRCA1/2 mutations, which confer an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and may also contribute to subfertility. All mature, sex steroid-producing ovarian follicles are drawn from the pool of non-renewable primordial follicles, termed the 'ovarian reserve'. The clinical implications of early ovarian reserve exhaustion extend beyond infertility, to include the long-term adverse health consequences of loss of endocrine function and premature menopause. We aimed to determine whether conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes impacts ovarian follicle numbers, oocyte quality and fertility in mice with advancing maternal age. We also aimed to determine the utility of AMH as a marker of ovarian function, by assessing circulating AMH levels in mice and women with BRCA1/2 mutations, and correlating this with ovarian follicle counts. METHODS: In this study, we addressed a longstanding question in the field regarding the functional consequences of BRCA1 inactivation in oocytes. To recapitulate loss of BRCA1 protein function in oocytes, we generated mice with conditional gene deletion of Brca1 in oocytes using Gdf9-Cre recombinase (WT: Brca1(fl/fl)Gdf9(+/+); cKO: Brca1(fl/fl)Gdf9(cre/+)). FINDINGS: While the length of the fertile lifespan was not altered between groups after a comprehensive breeding trial, conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes led to reduced litter size in female mice. Brca1 cKO animals had a reduced ovarian reserve and oocyte maturation was impaired with advanced maternal age at postnatal day (PN)300, compared to WT animals. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations (the gold-standard indirect marker of the ovarian reserve used in clinical practice) were not predictive of reduced primordial follicle number in Brca1 cKO mice versus WT. Furthermore, we found no correlation between follicle number or density and serum AMH concentrations in matched samples from a small cohort of premenopausal women with BRCA1/2 mutations. INTERPRETATION: Together, our data demonstrate that BRCA1 is a key regulator of oocyte number and quality in females and suggest that caution should be used in relying on AMH as a reliable marker of the ovarian reserve in this context.

            "标题: A genome-wide association study of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in Samoan women.\n",
            "摘要: STUDY QUESTION: Can a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) help identify genetic variation or genes associated with circulating anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in Samoan women? SUMMARY ANSWER: We identified eleven genome-wide suggestive loci (strongest association signal in ARID3A 19-946163-G-C [ p = 2.32 x 10(-)(7)]) and seven transcriptome-wide significant genes ( GINS2, SENP3, USP7, TUSC3, MAFA, METTL4, NDFIP1 [all with a p < 2.50 x 10(-)(6)]) associated with circulating AMH levels in Samoan women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Three prior GWASs of AMH levels identified eight loci in premenopausal women of European ancestry (AMH, MCM8, TEX41 , CHECK2, CDCA7 , EIF4EBP1, BMP4 and an uncharacterized non-coding RNA gene CTB-99A3.1 ), among which the MCM8 locus was shared among all three studies. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: We included a sample of 1,185 women from two independently recruited samples: a family study ( n = 212; [age: 18 to 40 years]) recruited in 2002-03 from Samoa and American Samoa; and the Soifua Manuia Study ( n = 973; age: 25 to 51 years), a crosssectional population-based study recruited in 2010 from Samoa. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Serum AMH levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We performed GWASs in the two participant samples using a Cox mixed-effects model to account for AMH levels below detectable limits and adjusted for centered age, centered age(2), polity, and kinship via kinship matrix. The summary statistics were then meta-analyzed using a fixed-effect model. We annotated the variants with p < 1 x 10(-)(5) and calculated posterior probability of causality for prioritization. We further annotated variants using FUMA and performed colocalization and transcriptome-wide association analysis. We also assessed whether any previously reported loci were replicated in our GWAS. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We identified eleven novel genome-wide suggestive loci ( p < 1 x 10(-)(5)) associated with AMH levels and replicated EIF4EBP1, a previously reported AMH locus, in the GWAS. The lead variant in ARID3A , 19-946163-G-C is in high linkage disequilibrium ( r (2) = 0.79) with the known age-at-menopause variant 19-950694-G-A. Nearby KISS1R is a biologically plausibility causal gene in the region; kisspeptin regulates ovarian follicle development and has been linked to AMH levels. Further investigation of the ARID3A locus is warranted. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitations of our study are the small sample size for a GWAS and the use of the transcription model trained on mostly European samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which may have led to reduced power to detect genotype-expression associations. Our findings need to be validated in larger Polynesian cohorts. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In addition to replicating one of the eight previously discovered AMH loci, we identified new suggestive associations. It is known that the inclusion of founder populations aids in the discovery of novel loci. These findings could enhance our understanding of AMH and AMH-related reproductive phenotypes (ovarian reserve, age at menopause, premature ovarian failure, and polycystic ovary syndrome) and help build a screening approach for women at risk for these phenotypes using genetically predicted AMH levels. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This work was funded by NIH grants R01-HL093093 (PI: S.T.M.), R01-HL133040 (PI: R.L.M.), and T90-DE030853 (PI: C.S. Sfeir).

            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Ovarian failure (OF) is a multifactorial, complex disease presented by up to 1% of women under 40 years of age. Despite 90% of patients being diagnosed with idiopathic OF, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown, making it difficult to personalize treatments for these patients in the clinical setting. Studying the presence and/or accumulation of SNVs at the gene/pathway levels will help describe novel genes and characterize disrupted biological pathways linked with ovarian failure. METHODS: Ad-hoc case-control SNV screening conducted from 2020 to 2023 of 150 VCF files WES data included Spanish IVF patients with (n = 118) and without (n = 32) OF (< 40 years of age; mean BMI 22.78) along with GnomAD (n = 38,947) and IGSR (n = 1,271; 258 European female VCF) data for pseudo-control female populations. SNVs were prioritized according to their predicted deleteriousness, frequency in genomic databases, and proportional differences across populations. A burden test was performed to reveal genes with a higher presence of SNVs in the OF cohort in comparison to control and pseudo-control groups. Systematic in-silico analyses were performed to assess the potential disruptions caused by the mutated genes in relevant biological pathways. Finally, genes with orthologues in Drosophila melanogaster were considered to experimentally validate the potential impediments to ovarian function and reproductive potential. RESULTS: Eighteen genes had a higher presence of SNVs in the OF population (FDR < 0.05). AK2, CDC27, CFTR, CTBP2, KMT2C, and MTCH2 were associated with OF for the first time and their silenced/knockout forms reduced fertility in Drosophila. We also predicted the disruption of 29 sub-pathways across four signalling pathways (FDR < 0.05). These sub-pathways included the metaphase to anaphase transition during oocyte meiosis, inflammatory processes related to necroptosis, DNA repair mismatch systems and the MAPK signalling cascade. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the underlying molecular mechanisms of OF, providing novel associations for six genes and OF-related infertility, setting a foundation for further biomarker development, and improving precision medicine in infertility.\n",

            "标题: Searching for the 'X' factor: investigating the genetics of primary ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is the cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40. The causes of POI are heterogeneous, but substantial evidence exists to support a genetic basis of POI, particularly in the critical involvement of genes on the X chromosome. Recent studies have revealed novel candidate genes through the identification of copy number variations associated with POI. This review summarizes the genes located on the X chromosome with variants shown to be associated with POI in humans and/or in mice. Additionally, we present evidence to support the potential involvement of these candidate genes in the etiology of POI. We conducted a literature search in PubMed to identify case studies and screenings for the genetic causes of POI. We then performed systematic searches for the proposed candidate genes to investigate their potential reproductive roles. Of the X-linked candidate genes investigated, 10 were found to have variants associated with cases of POI in humans. An additional 10 genes were found to play a supportive role in POI. Other genes were not implicated in any cases of POI but were associated with various roles in reproduction. In the majority of cases where variants were identified through whole-exome sequencing, rather than targeted screening of candidate genes, more than one genetic variant was identified. Overall, this review supports past findings that the X chromosome plays a critical role in ovarian function, as demonstrated by a link between POI and various disruptions to genes on the X chromosome. Current genetic screening for POI, which includes only FMR1, is inadequate to capture the majority of cases with a genetic origin. An expanded genetic testing may improve health outcomes for individuals with POI as it could lead to better early interventions and education about these health risks.\n",

            "标题: Investigation of an MCM8 gene variant in women with premature ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: INTRODUCTION: The MCM8 gene is involved in the homologous recombination and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. It maintains the meiotic process continuously. If the MCM8-9 helicase does not function, the accumulation of DNA breaks can result in cell death. Studies have reported MCM8 gene suppression with primary ovarian insufficiency. In the present study, a variant of the MCM8 gene was investigated in women with primary ovarian insufficiency to elucidate the role of MCM8 in this pathology. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of the NG_042869.1:g.40270G>A variant of the MCM8 gene in the study population. METHODS: The MCM8 gene variant was analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reaction using a hydrolysis probe in DNA samples from women diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency, with a normal karyotype and without FMR1 gene permutation, and from a Control Group, who had menopause after 50 years of age. Frequencies were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 100 samples from the Case Group and 100 samples from the Control Group were selected. The variant was detected in heterozygosity in a Case Group sample but was not identified in the Control Group. DISCUSSION: This variant was first described in a consanguineous Arab family. This variant is classified as pathogenic and has a prevalence of 1% in women with primary ovarian insufficiency. This study is a pioneering investigation of this variant in Brazilian women. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the rs138761187 variant of the MCM8 gene is rare in Brazilian women.\n",

            "标题: Biallelic Germline BRCA1 Frameshift Mutations Associated with Isolated Diminished Ovarian Reserve.\n",
            "摘要: The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently enabled the discovery of genetic causes of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) with high genetic heterogeneity. In contrast, the causes of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) remain poorly understood. Here, we identified by NGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) the cause of isolated DOR in a 14-year-old patient. Two frameshift mutations in BRCA1 (NM_007294.4) were found: in exon 8 (c.470_471del; p.Ser157Ter) and in exon 11 (c.791_794del, p.Ser264MetfsTer33). Unexpectedly, the patient presented no signs of Fanconi anemia (FA), i.e., no developmental abnormalities or indications of bone marrow failure. However, high chromosomal fragility was found in the patient's cells, consistent with an FA diagnosis. RT-PCR and Western-blot analysis support the fact that the c. 791_794del BRCA1 allele is transcribed and translated into a shorter protein (del11q), while no expression of the full-length BRCA1 protein was found. DNA damage response (DDR) studies after genotoxic agents demonstrate normal activation of the early stages of the DDR and FANC/BRCA pathway. This is consistent with the maintenance of residual repair activity for the del11q BRCA1 isoform. Our observation is the first implication of bi-allelic BRCA1 mutations in isolated ovarian dysfunction or infertility in humans, without clinical signs of FA, and highlights the importance of BRCA1 in ovarian development and function.\n",

            "标题: Multi-locus high-risk alleles association from interleukin's genes with female infertility and certain comorbidities.\n",
            "摘要: Objective There is evidence that cytokine genes' single nucleotide polymorphisms could be the reasons behind female infertility. This study aimed to identify the role for Interleukin33 rs1048274 (G > A) and rs16924243 (T > C), Interleukin22 rs1397852121 (C > T), rs1295978671 (C > T) and rs2227483 (A > T), Interleukin17A rs2275913 (G > A,C) and Interleukin17F rs763780 (T > C), Interleukin13 1512 (A > C) and IL13 2044 (G > A), and Interleukin4 rs2243250 (C > T) and rs2070874 (C > T) gene polymorphisms in female infertility to gain a richly more detailed understanding of its genetic predisposition. Five distinct groups, each comprising 200 infertile women and 200 age-matched fertile controls, were recruited to each Interleukins (33, 22, 17, 13 and 4) in this case-control study and were genotyped by using an amplification refractory mutation system. Statistical analysis is conducted by SPSS software V. 22 and using Chi-square (chi(2)) and logistic regression tests. Strength of association was estimated by multiple-comparison correction, population structure test and Haplotype analysis. The study was approved by the Academic Ethics Committee and each enrolled patient signed an informed consent.Results Our statistical results revealed risk alleles in all of the substitution lines for women infertility. Current findings provided evidence that in the presence of Interleukin33 A(p-value rs1048274 = 0.002) and C(p-value rs16924243 <) (0.0001), Interleukin 22T(p-value rs1397852121 < 0.0001) and T(p-value rs2227483 = 0.000), Interleukin17A A(p-value rs2275913 = 0.003) and Interleukin17F C(p-value rs763780 = 0.000) and Interleukin13 C(p-value 1512 = 0.000) and A(p-value 2044 = 0.003), Interleukin4 T(p-value rs2243250 = 0.001) and T(p-value rs2070874 = 0.009) risk alleles, risk genotype also were significantly associated with increased chances of developing infertility. The relationship between risk genotypes and several well-established infertility risk factors including, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, oophorectomy, diminished ovarian reserve, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, uterine polyps, fallopian tube blockage and thyroid dysfunction, also exhibited. This study suggests the significant role of interleukin gene polymorphisms in human reproductive success.\n",

            "标题: Relevant propositions for Y chromosome interpretation.\n",
            "摘要: The Y chromosomal haplotype is expected to be identical (or close to, depending on the mutation rate) among a male and many of his paternal relatives. This means that often the same evidential value for the DNA evidence is obtained, whether the true donor or one of his close paternal relatives is compared to a crime sample. Commentators (see for example the UK Forensic Science Regulator or Amorim) have suggested to change the proposition pair to compare the probability of the evidence if the Person of Interest (POI) or one of his close paternal relatives left the DNA to the probability of the evidence if an unrelated male from the population left the DNA. We argue that this is problematic because there is no clear definition of close paternal relatives and truly unrelated males do not exist. Instead, we take a starting point in the traditional proposition pair \"The source of the male DNA is the POI\" versus \"The source of the male DNA is not the POI\" and make the latter one operational by suggesting that it is formulated as \"The source of the male DNA is a random man from the population\". The issue of matching males in the POI's lineage is then addressed either in a comment in the statement or directly through a probability model.\n",

            "标题: MGA loss-of-function variants cause premature ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Although premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a common cause of female infertility and subfertility, has a well-established hereditary component, the genetic factors currently implicated in POI account for only a limited proportion of cases. Here, using an exome-wide, gene-based case-control analysis in a discovery cohort comprising 1,027 POI cases and 2,733 ethnically matched women controls from China, we found that heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants of MAX dimerization protein (MGA) were significantly enriched in the discovery cohort, accounting for 2.6% of POI cases, while no MGA LoF variants were found in the matched control females. Further exome screening was conducted in 4 additional POI cohorts (2 from China and 2 from the United States) for replication studies, and we identified heterozygous MGA LoF variants in 1.0%, 1.4%, 1.0%, and 1.0% of POI cases, respectively. Overall, a total of 37 distinct heterozygous MGA LoF variants were discovered in 38 POI cases, accounting for approximately 2.0% of the total 1,910 POI cases analyzed in this study. Accordingly, Mga+/- female mice were subfertile, exhibiting shorter reproductive lifespan and decreased follicle number compared with WT, mimicking the observed phenotype in humans. Our findings highlight the essential role of MGA deficiency for impaired female reproductive ability.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Genetic mutations have been reported in a number of bone disorders with or without extra-skeletal manifestations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the genetic cause in a middle-aged woman with osteoporosis, recurrent fractures and extraskeletal manifestations. METHODS: A 56-year-old Indian woman presented to the clinic with complaints of difficulty in walking, recurrent fractures, limb bending, progressive skeletal deformities, and poor overall health. At the age of 37, she had experienced severe anemia with diarrhea, significant weight loss, knuckle pigmentation, and a significant loss of scalp hair. She had received multiple blood transfusions and parenteral iron supplementation with normalization of hemoglobin. Subsequently, she had premature menopause at the age of 37. She died at the age of 61 due to liver failure. Exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing were undertaken to identify the potential pathogenic mutations. RESULTS: Genetic investigation identified likely pathogenic mutations in the LRP5 and LGR4 genes. Out of the two mutations, the heterozygous mutation (c.1199C>T) in the LRP5 gene resulted in a non-synonymous substitution of alanine with valine at the 400(th) position, and the second mutation (c.1403A>C) in the LGR4 gene led to a non-synonymous substitution of tyrosine with serine at the 468(th) residue of the protein. The minor allele frequencies of the c.1199C>T (LRP5) substitution in the 1000 genomes and IndiGenomes databases are 0.0003 and 0.001, while the c.1403A>C (LGR4) substitution has not been reported in these databases. Various in silico prediction tools suggested LGR4 mutation to be pathogenic and LRP5 mutation to be likely pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous mutations in the LRP5 and LGR4 genes had additive deteriorative effects on BMD, resulting in recurrent fractures and bone deformities, and extended the effect to extraskeletal sites, contributing to the poor overall health in this patient.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Premature menopause (PM) is defined as the end of ovulation before the age of 40 years, a condition commonly referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency. It has been shown there is an association between early menopause and a high risk of cardiovascular disease. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphisms related to premature menopause on cardio-metabolic disorders Objective: We aimed to investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with PM and the risk of cardio-metabolic disorders in the MASHAD cohort study. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 117 women with PM were recruited and compared with 183 healthy women. All participants were assessed for anthropometric indices and genotyped for eight selected polymorphisms within seven different genes. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in physical activity level (PAL) between the groups. Individuals with rs4806660 CC genotype had a 3.63-fold increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, individuals with a TT genotype of the rs2303369 polymorphism had a 3.11-- fold increased risk of obesity. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that genetic variations are risk factors related to cardio- metabolic disorders in women with premature menopause.\n",

            "标题: Identification and Characterization of Novel FSHR Copy Number Variations Causing Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a key pituitary gonadotropic hormone implicated in human fertility and is crucial for folliculogenesis and recruitment of new antral follicles. Variations in its receptor, FSHR, can lead to diverse reproductive phenotypes including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). This study reports a novel case of FSHR-related ovarian insufficiency in a patient with primary amenorrhea, subnormal AMH levels, and delayed puberty. Genetic exploration revealed two compound heterozygous intragenic deletions of FSHR. Specifically, the patient inherited a maternally derived deletion spanning exons 5-10 and a paternally derived deletion involving exons 3-6. Through chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), exome sequencing, long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing, we characterized the breakpoints and confirmed the compound heterozygous deletions. The findings reveal a complete loss of function of both FSHR alleles, contributing to the patient's POI phenotype. This case emphasizes the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in FSHR-related disorders and the role of CNVs in POI phenotypes. Although these events are rare, our results advocate for the inclusion of CNV detection in the diagnostic workup of POI to ensure accurate diagnosis and better patient management.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is one of the leading causes of female infertility. To date, the genetic etiology of POI has been elucidated in approximately 20-25% of the total cases. The human zona pellucida (ZP) plays an important role in the organization and differentiation of granulosa cells, follicle formation, and sperm recognition. Mutations in ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 have been reported to cause female infertility due to oocyte degeneration, empty follicle, or in vitro fertilization failure. In this study, we identified three novel missense mutations in ZP3 (NM_001110354.2): c.643G > A (p.Asp215Asn), c.215 C > T (p.Thr72Ile), and c.152T > C (p.Leu51Pro) in three sporadic Han Chinese POI patients through whole-exome sequencing. These variants are absent from population databases and were predicted to be deleterious by multiple in silico tools. Structure prediction analysis showed that the affected amino acid altered the ZP3 protein structure. Western blot further confirmed that these ZP3 variants reduced the expression and secretion of ZP components. In summary, this study reports three novel deleterious variants in ZP3 associated with POI, thereby broadening the mutation spectrum of ZP3 in POI patients.\n",

            "标题: AARS2-Related Disorder.\n",
            "摘要: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: AARS2-related disorder includes two distinct phenotypes, infantile-onset cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy. AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy is characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, skeletal myopathy, and often lung hypoplasia. Some individuals have nonimmune hydrops and/or seizures. AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy is characterized by movement disorders, cognitive decline, ovarian failure in females, and psychiatric manifestations. Additional neurologic manifestations (seizures, developmental delay, neuropathy, and/or myopathy) and ocular manifestations can also be present. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of AARS2-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in AARS2 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: In AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy, standard treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, and seizures; feeding therapy with tube feedings as required. In AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy, levodopa or other dopaminergic therapies for parkinsonism; botulinum toxin for spasticity; additional management of motor dysfunction per orthopedist, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist; cognitive behavioral therapy; psychoeducational interventions; treatment of hypogonadism in females per endocrinologist and/or gynecologist; psychotherapy and neuropsychological rehabilitation for neuropsychiatric manifestations; standard treatments for ocular manifestations and seizures. Surveillance: In AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy, cardiology evaluation including EKG and echocardiogram with frequency per cardiologist; assessment of growth and feeding at each visit; assessment of respiratory function as needed; neurologic evaluation, brain MRI, and EEG as needed. In AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy, neurologic assessment for movement disorders, changes in tone, and seizures every six months or as needed; assessment of mobility and self-help skills at each visit; assessment of cognitive function every six to 12 months; assessment for features of premature ovarian failure with frequency per endocrinologist and/or gynecologist; psychiatric assessment every six to 12 months; ophthalmology evaluation with frequency per ophthalmologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sedatives, antipsychotics, and other medications that may decrease alertness and increase the risk of falling should be used cautiously. GENETIC COUNSELING: AARS2-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an AARS2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the AARS2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterised by the loss or complete absence of ovarian activity in women under the age of 40. Clinical presentation of POI varies with phenotypic severity ranging from premature loss of menses to complete gonadal dysgenesis. POI is genetically heterogeneous with >100 causative gene variants identified thus far. The aetiology of POI varies from syndromic, idiopathic, monogenic to autoimmune causes the condition. Genetic diagnoses are beneficial to those impacted by POI as it allows for improved clinical management and fertility preservation. Identifying novel variants in candidate POI genes, however, is insufficient to make clinical diagnoses. The impact of missense variants can be predicted using bioinformatic algorithms but computational approaches have limitations and can generate false positive and false negative predictions. Functional characterisation of missense variants, is therefore imperative, particularly for genes lacking a well-established genotype:phenotype correlation. Here we used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the first case of a homozygous missense variant in DIS3 (c.2320C > T; p.His774Tyr) a critical component of the RNA exosome in a POI patient. This adds to the previously described compound heterozygous patient. We perform the first functional characterisation of a human POI-associated DIS3 variant. A slight defect in mitotic growth was caused by the variant in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Transgenic rescue of Dis3 knockdown in Drosophila melanogaster with human DIS3 carrying the patient variant led to aberrant ovarian development and egg chamber degeneration. This supports a potential deleterious impact of the human c.2320C > T; p.His774Tyr variant.\n",

            "标题: Population-based FMR1 carrier screening among reproductive women.\n",
            "摘要: PURPOSE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by an CGG repeat expansion (FM, > 200 CGG) in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. Female carriers of a premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG) can transmit the PM allele, which, depending on the CGG allele size, can expand to an allele in the FM range in the offspring. METHODS: Carrier screening for FMR1 PM is not available in Thailand. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PM carriers among Thai reproductive women at the tertiary hospital. A total of 1250 females participated in this study; ages ranged from 20 to 45 years, mean of 30 years (S.D. = 6.27). RESULTS: Two carriers of a premutation allele, with 32,62 and 32,69 CGG repeats respectively, were identified. This corresponds to 1 in 600 women or 0.17% of the population. Further, three women carrying a gray zone allele (45-54 CGG repeats) were identified (29,51; 29,49; and 30,47 CGG repeats) which equals to 1:400 women or 0.25% of the population. No FM case was detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study heightens the importance of PM carrier screening of women of reproductive age, particularly for the higher risk of developing fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Early identification of PM carrier status enhances family planning and fecundity alternatives and improves reproductive health outcomes leading to a better life.\n",

            "摘要: Primordial follicles (PFs) function as the long-term reserve for female reproduction, remaining dormant in the ovaries and becoming progressively depleted with age. Oxidative stress plays an important role in promoting female reproductive senescence during aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we find that low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for sustaining PF dormancy. Compared to growing follicles, oocytes within PFs were shown to be more susceptible to ROS, which accumulates and damages PFs to promote reproductive senescence. Mechanistically, oocytes within PFs were shown to express high levels of the intracellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), counteracting ROS accumulation. Decreased SOD1 expression, as a result of aging or through the experimental deletion of the Sod1 gene in oocytes, resulted in increased oxidative stress and triggered ferroptosis within PFs. In conclusion, this study identified antioxidant defense mechanisms protecting PFs in mouse ovaries and characterized cell death mechanisms of oxidative stress-induced PF death.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is the main cause of infertility in women. Some cases of POI are thought to be caused by genetic defects and the clinical outcomes of these patients are unknown. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of the peripheral blood of a cohort of 55 subjects with POI and identified one heterozygous missense variant in FOXL2 (c.1045G>C; p.Arg349Gly) and two heterozygous missense variants in ERCC6 (c.379G>A; p.Val127Ile and c.4223A>C; p.Glu1408 Ala) in four POI patients. All of these heterozygous mutations were predicted to be deleterious and were parentally inherited from their heterozygous fathers. The mRNA and protein expression of FOXL2 and ERCC6 were absent or decreased in the patients. The patients carrying the variants of FOXL2 (c.1045G>C; p.Arg349Gly) and ERCC6 (c.379G>A; p.Val127Ile) failed to conceive in two and four assisted reproductive cycles, respectively. Another patient and her sister carrying the ERCC6 (c.4223A>C; p.Glu1408 Ala) variant achieved good clinical outcomes after assisted reproductive therapy. Our findings support the possible roles of FOXL2 and ERCC6 in POI and might contribute to the genetic counseling of POI patients.\n",

            "摘要: The relationship between premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and premutation in the FMR1 gene is well established. In recent years, though, a potential relationship between the latter and a low ovarian reserve has been suggested. To explore it, we conducted a retrospective study in an IVF program at a university tertiary referral center in Barcelona (Spain). Data were obtained retrospectively from a total of 385 women referred for FMR1 gene testing at our institution from January 2018 to December 2021. We compared the prevalence of FMR1 gene premutation between 93 of them, younger than 35 years, with a diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), characterized by levels of anti-Mullerian hormone < 1.1 ng/mL and antral follicle count < 5; and 132 egg donors screened by protocol that served as the controls. We found a higher prevalence of FMR1 premutation in the DOR group (seven patients (7.69%)) than in the control group (one patient (1.32%)), Fisher-exact test p-value = 0.012). We concluded that compared with the general population represented by young egg donors, the prevalence of FMR1 gene premutation is higher in young patients with a diminished ovarian reserve. Although these findings warrant further prospective validation in a larger cohort of patients within DOR, they suggest that, in clinical practice, FMR1 premutation should be determined in infertile young patients with DOR in order to give them adequate genetic counselling.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as the depletion of ovarian function before the age of 40 years. The global prevalence of POI is 3.5%. To date, genetic factors account for 23.5% of the etiology of POI. Herein, a previously uncharacterized pathogenic homozygous variant of the chromosome segregation-1-like gene (CSE1L) was identified in POI patients via targeted panel sequencing. It is reported that dysregulated iron metabolism is involved in many reproductive endocrine disorders; however, its precise role in POI remains obscure. In this study, we identified CSE1L as a potential candidate gene that plays an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis. Deficiency of CSE1L led to ferroptosis in human granulosa cells, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Mechanistically, coimmunoprecipitation identified the direct interaction between CSE1L and FoxO1. Inhibition of CSE1L led to the excessive accumulation of FoxO1 in the nucleus via nucleocytoplasmic transport. Then, FoxO1 bound to the promoter region of NCOA4 and promoted its transcription, which was verified by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, inhibition of CSE1L in cumulus cell monolayer could impede oocyte maturation, which might be associated with oxidative stress. Consequently, our study first revealed that CSE1L participated in ferroptosis in human ovarian granulosa cells via nucleocytoplasmic transportation, which might be helpful in revealing the molecular mechanism of CSE1L in the development of POI. Importantly, these findings might provide new insights into the application of ferroptosis inhibitors in the treatment of POI.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND/AIM: The tumor suppressor CDKN2C (also designed as p18(INK4C) or p18) is deleted in approximately 7% to 40% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, indicative of its potential association with myeloma pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quantitative real-time PCR-based assay was developed to determine p18 deletion in DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a cohort of 108 multiple myeloma patients after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Additionally, the p18 mRNA expression level in PBMCs was quantitatively assessed using Taqman((R)) gene expression assays. RESULTS: p18 was homozygously and hemizygously deleted in PBMCs from 3 (2.8%) and 5 (4.6%) patients, respectively. Neither the p18 deletion nor the p18 mRNA levels in PBMCs were associated with progression-free survival (PFS), 90-day response, and the occurrence of severe mucositis in these patients (all p-values >0.20). CONCLUSION: Neither p18 deletion nor p18 mRNA expression in PBMCs can be used as a prognostic biomarker in MM patients.\n",

            "摘要: Age at menopause (AOM) has a substantial impact on fertility and disease risk. While many loci with variants that associate with AOM have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) under an additive model, other genetic models are rarely considered(1). Here through GWAS meta-analysis under the recessive model of 174,329 postmenopausal women from Iceland, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK; UK Biobank) and Norway, we study low-frequency variants with a large effect on AOM. We discovered that women homozygous for the stop-gain variant rs117316434 (A) in CCDC201 (p.(Arg162Ter), minor allele frequency ~1%) reached menopause 9 years earlier than other women (P = 1.3 x 10(-15)). The genotype is present in one in 10,000 northern European women and leads to primary ovarian insufficiency in close to half of them. Consequently, homozygotes have fewer children, and the age at last childbirth is 5 years earlier (P = 3.8 x 10(-5)). The CCDC201 gene was only found in humans in 2022 and is highly expressed in oocytes. Homozygosity for CCDC201 loss-of-function has a substantial impact on female reproductive health, and homozygotes would benefit from reproductive counseling and treatment for symptoms of early menopause.\n",

            "标题: Oocyte-specific deletion of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 causes apoptosis of mouse oocytes within the early-growing follicles by mitochondrial fission defect-reactive oxygen species-DNA damage.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Mutations in several translation initiation factors are closely associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), but the underlying pathogenesis remains largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (Eif5) conditional knockout mice aiming to investigate the function of eIF5 during oocyte growth and follicle development. Here, we demonstrated that Eif5 deletion in mouse primordial and growing oocytes both resulted in the apoptosis of oocytes within the early-growing follicles. Further studies revealed that Eif5 deletion in oocytes downregulated the levels of mitochondrial fission-related proteins (p-DRP1, FIS1, MFF and MTFR) and upregulated the levels of the integrated stress response-related proteins (AARS1, SHMT2 and SLC7A1) and genes (Atf4, Ddit3 and Fgf21). Consistent with this, Eif5 deletion in oocytes resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by elongated form, aggregated distribution beneath the oocyte membrane, decreased adenosine triphosphate content and mtDNA copy numbers, and excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Meanwhile, Eif5 deletion in oocytes led to a significant increase in the levels of DNA damage response proteins (gammaH2AX, p-CHK2 and p-p53) and proapoptotic proteins (PUMA and BAX), as well as a significant decrease in the levels of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Eif5 deletion in mouse oocytes results in the apoptosis of oocytes within the early-growing follicles via mitochondrial fission defects, excessive ROS accumulation and DNA damage. This study provides new insights into pathogenesis, genetic diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets for POI. KEY POINTS: Eif5 deletion in oocytes leads to arrest in oocyte growth and follicle development. Eif5 deletion in oocytes impairs the translation of mitochondrial fission-related proteins, followed by mitochondrial dysfunction. Depletion of Eif5 causes oocyte apoptosis via ROS accumulation and DNA damage response pathway.\n",

            "摘要: Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) is a highly heterogeneous condition characterized by ovarian dysfunction in women occurring before the age of 40, representing a significant cause of female infertility. It manifests through primary or secondary amenorrhea. While more than half of POI cases are idiopathic, genetic factors play a pivotal role in all instances with known causes, contributing to approximately 20-25% of cases. This article comprehensively reviews the genetic factors associated with POI, delineating the primary candidate genes. The discussion delves into the intricate relationship between these genes and ovarian development, elucidating the functional consequences of diverse mutations to underscore the fundamental impact of genetic effects on POI. The identified genetic factors, encompassing gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, are systematically classified based on whether the resulting POI is syndromic or non-syndromic. Furthermore, this paper explores the genetic interplay between mitochondrial genes, such as Required for Meiotic Nuclear Division 1 homolog Gene (RMND1), Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S22 Gene (MRPS22), Leucine-rich Pentapeptide Repeat Gene (LRPPRC), and non-coding RNAs, including both microRNAs and Long non-coding RNAs, with POI. The insights provided serve to consolidate and enhance our understanding of the etiology of POI, contributing to establishing a theoretical foundation for diagnosing and treating POI patients, as well as for exploring the mechanisms underlying the disease.\n",

            "标题: Conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes causes reduced litter size, ovarian reserve depletion and impaired oocyte in vitro maturation with advanced reproductive age in mice.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: An estimated 1 in 350 women carry germline BRCA1/2 mutations, which confer an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and may also contribute to subfertility. All mature, sex steroid-producing ovarian follicles are drawn from the pool of non-renewable primordial follicles, termed the 'ovarian reserve'. The clinical implications of early ovarian reserve exhaustion extend beyond infertility, to include the long-term adverse health consequences of loss of endocrine function and premature menopause. We aimed to determine whether conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes impacts ovarian follicle numbers, oocyte quality and fertility in mice with advancing maternal age. We also aimed to determine the utility of AMH as a marker of ovarian function, by assessing circulating AMH levels in mice and women with BRCA1/2 mutations, and correlating this with ovarian follicle counts. METHODS: In this study, we addressed a longstanding question in the field regarding the functional consequences of BRCA1 inactivation in oocytes. To recapitulate loss of BRCA1 protein function in oocytes, we generated mice with conditional gene deletion of Brca1 in oocytes using Gdf9-Cre recombinase (WT: Brca1(fl/fl)Gdf9(+/+); cKO: Brca1(fl/fl)Gdf9(cre/+)). FINDINGS: While the length of the fertile lifespan was not altered between groups after a comprehensive breeding trial, conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes led to reduced litter size in female mice. Brca1 cKO animals had a reduced ovarian reserve and oocyte maturation was impaired with advanced maternal age at postnatal day (PN)300, compared to WT animals. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations (the gold-standard indirect marker of the ovarian reserve used in clinical practice) were not predictive of reduced primordial follicle number in Brca1 cKO mice versus WT. Furthermore, we found no correlation between follicle number or density and serum AMH concentrations in matched samples from a small cohort of premenopausal women with BRCA1/2 mutations. INTERPRETATION: Together, our data demonstrate that BRCA1 is a key regulator of oocyte number and quality in females and suggest that caution should be used in relying on AMH as a reliable marker of the ovarian reserve in this context.

            "标题: A genome-wide association study of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in Samoan women.\n",
            "摘要: STUDY QUESTION: Can a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) help identify genetic variation or genes associated with circulating anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in Samoan women? SUMMARY ANSWER: We identified eleven genome-wide suggestive loci (strongest association signal in ARID3A 19-946163-G-C [ p = 2.32 x 10(-)(7)]) and seven transcriptome-wide significant genes ( GINS2, SENP3, USP7, TUSC3, MAFA, METTL4, NDFIP1 [all with a p < 2.50 x 10(-)(6)]) associated with circulating AMH levels in Samoan women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Three prior GWASs of AMH levels identified eight loci in premenopausal women of European ancestry (AMH, MCM8, TEX41 , CHECK2, CDCA7 , EIF4EBP1, BMP4 and an uncharacterized non-coding RNA gene CTB-99A3.1 ), among which the MCM8 locus was shared among all three studies. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: We included a sample of 1,185 women from two independently recruited samples: a family study ( n = 212; [age: 18 to 40 years]) recruited in 2002-03 from Samoa and American Samoa; and the Soifua Manuia Study ( n = 973; age: 25 to 51 years), a crosssectional population-based study recruited in 2010 from Samoa. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Serum AMH levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We performed GWASs in the two participant samples using a Cox mixed-effects model to account for AMH levels below detectable limits and adjusted for centered age, centered age(2), polity, and kinship via kinship matrix. The summary statistics were then meta-analyzed using a fixed-effect model. We annotated the variants with p < 1 x 10(-)(5) and calculated posterior probability of causality for prioritization. We further annotated variants using FUMA and performed colocalization and transcriptome-wide association analysis. We also assessed whether any previously reported loci were replicated in our GWAS. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We identified eleven novel genome-wide suggestive loci ( p < 1 x 10(-)(5)) associated with AMH levels and replicated EIF4EBP1, a previously reported AMH locus, in the GWAS. The lead variant in ARID3A , 19-946163-G-C is in high linkage disequilibrium ( r (2) = 0.79) with the known age-at-menopause variant 19-950694-G-A. Nearby KISS1R is a biologically plausibility causal gene in the region; kisspeptin regulates ovarian follicle development and has been linked to AMH levels. Further investigation of the ARID3A locus is warranted. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitations of our study are the small sample size for a GWAS and the use of the transcription model trained on mostly European samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which may have led to reduced power to detect genotype-expression associations. Our findings need to be validated in larger Polynesian cohorts. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In addition to replicating one of the eight previously discovered AMH loci, we identified new suggestive associations. It is known that the inclusion of founder populations aids in the discovery of novel loci. These findings could enhance our understanding of AMH and AMH-related reproductive phenotypes (ovarian reserve, age at menopause, premature ovarian failure, and polycystic ovary syndrome) and help build a screening approach for women at risk for these phenotypes using genetically predicted AMH levels.

            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Ovarian failure (OF) is a multifactorial, complex disease presented by up to 1% of women under 40 years of age. Despite 90% of patients being diagnosed with idiopathic OF, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown, making it difficult to personalize treatments for these patients in the clinical setting. Studying the presence and/or accumulation of SNVs at the gene/pathway levels will help describe novel genes and characterize disrupted biological pathways linked with ovarian failure. METHODS: Ad-hoc case-control SNV screening conducted from 2020 to 2023 of 150 VCF files WES data included Spanish IVF patients with (n = 118) and without (n = 32) OF (< 40 years of age; mean BMI 22.78) along with GnomAD (n = 38,947) and IGSR (n = 1,271; 258 European female VCF) data for pseudo-control female populations. SNVs were prioritized according to their predicted deleteriousness, frequency in genomic databases, and proportional differences across populations. A burden test was performed to reveal genes with a higher presence of SNVs in the OF cohort in comparison to control and pseudo-control groups. Systematic in-silico analyses were performed to assess the potential disruptions caused by the mutated genes in relevant biological pathways. Finally, genes with orthologues in Drosophila melanogaster were considered to experimentally validate the potential impediments to ovarian function and reproductive potential. RESULTS: Eighteen genes had a higher presence of SNVs in the OF population (FDR < 0.05). AK2, CDC27, CFTR, CTBP2, KMT2C, and MTCH2 were associated with OF for the first time and their silenced/knockout forms reduced fertility in Drosophila. We also predicted the disruption of 29 sub-pathways across four signalling pathways (FDR < 0.05). These sub-pathways included the metaphase to anaphase transition during oocyte meiosis, inflammatory processes related to necroptosis, DNA repair mismatch systems and the MAPK signalling cascade. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the underlying molecular mechanisms of OF, providing novel associations for six genes and OF-related infertility, setting a foundation for further biomarker development, and improving precision medicine in infertility.\n",

            "标题: Searching for the 'X' factor: investigating the genetics of primary ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is the cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40. The causes of POI are heterogeneous, but substantial evidence exists to support a genetic basis of POI, particularly in the critical involvement of genes on the X chromosome. Recent studies have revealed novel candidate genes through the identification of copy number variations associated with POI. This review summarizes the genes located on the X chromosome with variants shown to be associated with POI in humans and/or in mice. Additionally, we present evidence to support the potential involvement of these candidate genes in the etiology of POI. We conducted a literature search in PubMed to identify case studies and screenings for the genetic causes of POI. We then performed systematic searches for the proposed candidate genes to investigate their potential reproductive roles. Of the X-linked candidate genes investigated, 10 were found to have variants associated with cases of POI in humans. An additional 10 genes were found to play a supportive role in POI. Other genes were not implicated in any cases of POI but were associated with various roles in reproduction. In the majority of cases where variants were identified through whole-exome sequencing, rather than targeted screening of candidate genes, more than one genetic variant was identified. Overall, this review supports past findings that the X chromosome plays a critical role in ovarian function, as demonstrated by a link between POI and various disruptions to genes on the X chromosome. Current genetic screening for POI, which includes only FMR1, is inadequate to capture the majority of cases with a genetic origin. An expanded genetic testing may improve health outcomes for individuals with POI as it could lead to better early interventions and education about these health risks.\n",

            "标题: Investigation of an MCM8 gene variant in women with premature ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: INTRODUCTION: The MCM8 gene is involved in the homologous recombination and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. It maintains the meiotic process continuously. If the MCM8-9 helicase does not function, the accumulation of DNA breaks can result in cell death. Studies have reported MCM8 gene suppression with primary ovarian insufficiency. In the present study, a variant of the MCM8 gene was investigated in women with primary ovarian insufficiency to elucidate the role of MCM8 in this pathology. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of the NG_042869.1:g.40270G>A variant of the MCM8 gene in the study population. METHODS: The MCM8 gene variant was analyzed via real-time polymerase chain reaction using a hydrolysis probe in DNA samples from women diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency, with a normal karyotype and without FMR1 gene permutation, and from a Control Group, who had menopause after 50 years of age. Frequencies were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 100 samples from the Case Group and 100 samples from the Control Group were selected. The variant was detected in heterozygosity in a Case Group sample but was not identified in the Control Group. DISCUSSION: This variant was first described in a consanguineous Arab family. This variant is classified as pathogenic and has a prevalence of 1% in women with primary ovarian insufficiency. This study is a pioneering investigation of this variant in Brazilian women. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the rs138761187 variant of the MCM8 gene is rare in Brazilian women.\n",

            "标题: Biallelic Germline BRCA1 Frameshift Mutations Associated with Isolated Diminished Ovarian Reserve.\n",
            "摘要: The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently enabled the discovery of genetic causes of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) with high genetic heterogeneity. In contrast, the causes of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) remain poorly understood. Here, we identified by NGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) the cause of isolated DOR in a 14-year-old patient. Two frameshift mutations in BRCA1 (NM_007294.4) were found: in exon 8 (c.470_471del; p.Ser157Ter) and in exon 11 (c.791_794del, p.Ser264MetfsTer33). Unexpectedly, the patient presented no signs of Fanconi anemia (FA), i.e., no developmental abnormalities or indications of bone marrow failure. However, high chromosomal fragility was found in the patient's cells, consistent with an FA diagnosis. RT-PCR and Western-blot analysis support the fact that the c. 791_794del BRCA1 allele is transcribed and translated into a shorter protein (del11q), while no expression of the full-length BRCA1 protein was found. DNA damage response (DDR) studies after genotoxic agents demonstrate normal activation of the early stages of the DDR and FANC/BRCA pathway. This is consistent with the maintenance of residual repair activity for the del11q BRCA1 isoform. Our observation is the first implication of bi-allelic BRCA1 mutations in isolated ovarian dysfunction or infertility in humans, without clinical signs of FA, and highlights the importance of BRCA1 in ovarian development and function.\n",

This study aimed to identify the role for Interleukin33 rs1048274 (G > A) and rs16924243 (T > C), Interleukin22 rs1397852121 (C > T), rs1295978671 (C > T) and rs2227483 (A > T), Interleukin17A rs2275913 (G > A,C) and Interleukin17F rs763780 (T > C), Interleukin13 1512 (A > C) and IL13 2044 (G > A), and Interleukin4 rs2243250 (C > T) and rs2070874 (C > T) gene polymorphisms in female infertility to gain a richly more detailed understanding of its genetic predisposition. Five distinct groups, each comprising 200 infertile women and 200 age-matched fertile controls, were recruited to each Interleukins (33, 22, 17, 13 and 4) in this case-control study and were genotyped by using an amplification refractory mutation system. Statistical analysis is conducted by SPSS software V. 22 and using Chi-square (chi(2)) and logistic regression tests. Strength of association was estimated by multiple-comparison correction, population structure test and Haplotype analysis. The study was approved by the Academic Ethics Committee and each enrolled patient signed an informed consent.Results Our statistical results revealed risk alleles in all of the substitution lines for women infertility. Current findings provided evidence that in the presence of Interleukin33 A(p-value rs1048274 = 0.002) and C(p-value rs16924243 <) (0.0001), Interleukin 22T(p-value rs1397852121 < 0.0001) and T(p-value rs2227483 = 0.000), Interleukin17A A(p-value rs2275913 = 0.003) and Interleukin17F C(p-value rs763780 = 0.000) and Interleukin13 C(p-value 1512 = 0.000) and A(p-value 2044 = 0.003), Interleukin4 T(p-value rs2243250 = 0.001) and T(p-value rs2070874 = 0.009) risk alleles, risk genotype also were significantly associated with increased chances of developing infertility. The relationship between risk genotypes and several well-established infertility risk factors including, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, oophorectomy, diminished ovarian reserve, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, uterine polyps, fallopian tube blockage and thyroid dysfunction, also exhibited. This study suggests the significant role of interleukin gene polymorphisms in human reproductive success.\n",

            "标题: Relevant propositions for Y chromosome interpretation.\n",
            "摘要: The Y chromosomal haplotype is expected to be identical (or close to, depending on the mutation rate) among a male and many of his paternal relatives. This means that often the same evidential value for the DNA evidence is obtained, whether the true donor or one of his close paternal relatives is compared to a crime sample. Commentators (see for example the UK Forensic Science Regulator or Amorim) have suggested to change the proposition pair to compare the probability of the evidence if the Person of Interest (POI) or one of his close paternal relatives left the DNA to the probability of the evidence if an unrelated male from the population left the DNA. We argue that this is problematic because there is no clear definition of close paternal relatives and truly unrelated males do not exist. Instead, we take a starting point in the traditional proposition pair \"The source of the male DNA is the POI\" versus \"The source of the male DNA is not the POI\" and make the latter one operational by suggesting that it is formulated as \"The source of the male DNA is a random man from the population\". The issue of matching males in the POI's lineage is then addressed either in a comment in the statement or directly through a probability model.\n",

            "标题: MGA loss-of-function variants cause premature ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Although premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a common cause of female infertility and subfertility, has a well-established hereditary component, the genetic factors currently implicated in POI account for only a limited proportion of cases. Here, using an exome-wide, gene-based case-control analysis in a discovery cohort comprising 1,027 POI cases and 2,733 ethnically matched women controls from China, we found that heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants of MAX dimerization protein (MGA) were significantly enriched in the discovery cohort, accounting for 2.6% of POI cases, while no MGA LoF variants were found in the matched control females. Further exome screening was conducted in 4 additional POI cohorts (2 from China and 2 from the United States) for replication studies, and we identified heterozygous MGA LoF variants in 1.0%, 1.4%, 1.0%, and 1.0% of POI cases, respectively. Overall, a total of 37 distinct heterozygous MGA LoF variants were discovered in 38 POI cases, accounting for approximately 2.0% of the total 1,910 POI cases analyzed in this study. Accordingly, Mga+/- female mice were subfertile, exhibiting shorter reproductive lifespan and decreased follicle number compared with WT, mimicking the observed phenotype in humans. Our findings highlight the essential role of MGA deficiency for impaired female reproductive ability.\n",

            "标题: Case report: exome sequencing identified mutations in the LRP5 and LGR4 genes in a case of osteoporosis with recurrent fractures and extraskeletal manifestations.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Genetic mutations have been reported in a number of bone disorders with or without extra-skeletal manifestations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the genetic cause in a middle-aged woman with osteoporosis, recurrent fractures and extraskeletal manifestations. METHODS: A 56-year-old Indian woman presented to the clinic with complaints of difficulty in walking, recurrent fractures, limb bending, progressive skeletal deformities, and poor overall health. At the age of 37, she had experienced severe anemia with diarrhea, significant weight loss, knuckle pigmentation, and a significant loss of scalp hair. She had received multiple blood transfusions and parenteral iron supplementation with normalization of hemoglobin. Subsequently, she had premature menopause at the age of 37. She died at the age of 61 due to liver failure. Exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing were undertaken to identify the potential pathogenic mutations. RESULTS: Genetic investigation identified likely pathogenic mutations in the LRP5 and LGR4 genes. Out of the two mutations, the heterozygous mutation (c.1199C>T) in the LRP5 gene resulted in a non-synonymous substitution of alanine with valine at the 400(th) position, and the second mutation (c.1403A>C) in the LGR4 gene led to a non-synonymous substitution of tyrosine with serine at the 468(th) residue of the protein. The minor allele frequencies of the c.1199C>T (LRP5) substitution in the 1000 genomes and IndiGenomes databases are 0.0003 and 0.001, while the c.1403A>C (LGR4) substitution has not been reported in these databases. Various in silico prediction tools suggested LGR4 mutation to be pathogenic and LRP5 mutation to be likely pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous mutations in the LRP5 and LGR4 genes had additive deteriorative effects on BMD, resulting in recurrent fractures and bone deformities, and extended the effect to extraskeletal sites, contributing to the poor overall health in this patient.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Premature menopause (PM) is defined as the end of ovulation before the age of 40 years, a condition commonly referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency. It has been shown there is an association between early menopause and a high risk of cardiovascular disease. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphisms related to premature menopause on cardio-metabolic disorders Objective: We aimed to investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with PM and the risk of cardio-metabolic disorders in the MASHAD cohort study. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 117 women with PM were recruited and compared with 183 healthy women. All participants were assessed for anthropometric indices and genotyped for eight selected polymorphisms within seven different genes. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in physical activity level (PAL) between the groups. Individuals with rs4806660 CC genotype had a 3.63-fold increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, individuals with a TT genotype of the rs2303369 polymorphism had a 3.11-- fold increased risk of obesity. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that genetic variations are risk factors related to cardio- metabolic disorders in women with premature menopause.\n",

            "标题: Identification and Characterization of Novel FSHR Copy Number Variations Causing Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a key pituitary gonadotropic hormone implicated in human fertility and is crucial for folliculogenesis and recruitment of new antral follicles. Variations in its receptor, FSHR, can lead to diverse reproductive phenotypes including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). This study reports a novel case of FSHR-related ovarian insufficiency in a patient with primary amenorrhea, subnormal AMH levels, and delayed puberty. Genetic exploration revealed two compound heterozygous intragenic deletions of FSHR. Specifically, the patient inherited a maternally derived deletion spanning exons 5-10 and a paternally derived deletion involving exons 3-6. Through chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), exome sequencing, long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing, we characterized the breakpoints and confirmed the compound heterozygous deletions. The findings reveal a complete loss of function of both FSHR alleles, contributing to the patient's POI phenotype. This case emphasizes the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in FSHR-related disorders and the role of CNVs in POI phenotypes. Although these events are rare, our results advocate for the inclusion of CNV detection in the diagnostic workup of POI to ensure accurate diagnosis and better patient management.\n",

            "标题: Novel Loss-of-function Variants of ZP3 Associated with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is one of the leading causes of female infertility. To date, the genetic etiology of POI has been elucidated in approximately 20-25% of the total cases. The human zona pellucida (ZP) plays an important role in the organization and differentiation of granulosa cells, follicle formation, and sperm recognition. Mutations in ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3 have been reported to cause female infertility due to oocyte degeneration, empty follicle, or in vitro fertilization failure. In this study, we identified three novel missense mutations in ZP3 (NM_001110354.2): c.643G > A (p.Asp215Asn), c.215 C > T (p.Thr72Ile), and c.152T > C (p.Leu51Pro) in three sporadic Han Chinese POI patients through whole-exome sequencing. These variants are absent from population databases and were predicted to be deleterious by multiple in silico tools. Structure prediction analysis showed that the affected amino acid altered the ZP3 protein structure. Western blot further confirmed that these ZP3 variants reduced the expression and secretion of ZP components. In summary, this study reports three novel deleterious variants in ZP3 associated with POI, thereby broadening the mutation spectrum of ZP3 in POI patients.\n",

            "标题: AARS2-Related Disorder.\n",
            "摘要: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: AARS2-related disorder includes two distinct phenotypes, infantile-onset cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy. AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy is characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, skeletal myopathy, and often lung hypoplasia. Some individuals have nonimmune hydrops and/or seizures. AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy is characterized by movement disorders, cognitive decline, ovarian failure in females, and psychiatric manifestations. Additional neurologic manifestations (seizures, developmental delay, neuropathy, and/or myopathy) and ocular manifestations can also be present. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of AARS2-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in AARS2 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: In AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy, standard treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, and seizures; feeding therapy with tube feedings as required. In AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy, levodopa or other dopaminergic therapies for parkinsonism; botulinum toxin for spasticity; additional management of motor dysfunction per orthopedist, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist; cognitive behavioral therapy; psychoeducational interventions; treatment of hypogonadism in females per endocrinologist and/or gynecologist; psychotherapy and neuropsychological rehabilitation for neuropsychiatric manifestations; standard treatments for ocular manifestations and seizures. Surveillance: In AARS2-related infantile-onset cardiomyopathy, cardiology evaluation including EKG and echocardiogram with frequency per cardiologist; assessment of growth and feeding at each visit; assessment of respiratory function as needed; neurologic evaluation, brain MRI, and EEG as needed. In AARS2-related neurodegeneration with or without leukoencephalopathy, neurologic assessment for movement disorders, changes in tone, and seizures every six months or as needed; assessment of mobility and self-help skills at each visit; assessment of cognitive function every six to 12 months; assessment for features of premature ovarian failure with frequency per endocrinologist and/or gynecologist; psychiatric assessment every six to 12 months; ophthalmology evaluation with frequency per ophthalmologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sedatives, antipsychotics, and other medications that may decrease alertness and increase the risk of falling should be used cautiously. GENETIC COUNSELING: AARS2-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an AARS2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the AARS2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.\n",

            "标题: Functional characterisation of human recessive DIS3 variants in premature ovarian insufficiency.\n",
            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterised by the loss or complete absence of ovarian activity in women under the age of 40. Clinical presentation of POI varies with phenotypic severity ranging from premature loss of menses to complete gonadal dysgenesis. POI is genetically heterogeneous with >100 causative gene variants identified thus far. The aetiology of POI varies from syndromic, idiopathic, monogenic to autoimmune causes the condition. Genetic diagnoses are beneficial to those impacted by POI as it allows for improved clinical management and fertility preservation. Identifying novel variants in candidate POI genes, however, is insufficient to make clinical diagnoses. The impact of missense variants can be predicted using bioinformatic algorithms but computational approaches have limitations and can generate false positive and false negative predictions. Functional characterisation of missense variants, is therefore imperative, particularly for genes lacking a well-established genotype:phenotype correlation. Here we used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the first case of a homozygous missense variant in DIS3 (c.2320C > T; p.His774Tyr) a critical component of the RNA exosome in a POI patient. This adds to the previously described compound heterozygous patient. We perform the first functional characterisation of a human POI-associated DIS3 variant. A slight defect in mitotic growth was caused by the variant in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Transgenic rescue of Dis3 knockdown in Drosophila melanogaster with human DIS3 carrying the patient variant led to aberrant ovarian development and egg chamber degeneration. This supports a potential deleterious impact of the human c.2320C > T; p.His774Tyr variant.\n",

            "标题: Population-based FMR1 carrier screening among reproductive women.\n",
            "摘要: PURPOSE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by an CGG repeat expansion (FM, > 200 CGG) in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. Female carriers of a premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG) can transmit the PM allele, which, depending on the CGG allele size, can expand to an allele in the FM range in the offspring. METHODS: Carrier screening for FMR1 PM is not available in Thailand. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PM carriers among Thai reproductive women at the tertiary hospital. A total of 1250 females participated in this study; ages ranged from 20 to 45 years, mean of 30 years (S.D. = 6.27). RESULTS: Two carriers of a premutation allele, with 32,62 and 32,69 CGG repeats respectively, were identified. This corresponds to 1 in 600 women or 0.17% of the population. Further, three women carrying a gray zone allele (45-54 CGG repeats) were identified (29,51; 29,49; and 30,47 CGG repeats) which equals to 1:400 women or 0.25% of the population. No FM case was detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study heightens the importance of PM carrier screening of women of reproductive age, particularly for the higher risk of developing fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Early identification of PM carrier status enhances family planning and fecundity alternatives and improves reproductive health outcomes leading to a better life.\n",

            "摘要: Primordial follicles (PFs) function as the long-term reserve for female reproduction, remaining dormant in the ovaries and becoming progressively depleted with age. Oxidative stress plays an important role in promoting female reproductive senescence during aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we find that low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for sustaining PF dormancy. Compared to growing follicles, oocytes within PFs were shown to be more susceptible to ROS, which accumulates and damages PFs to promote reproductive senescence. Mechanistically, oocytes within PFs were shown to express high levels of the intracellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), counteracting ROS accumulation. Decreased SOD1 expression, as a result of aging or through the experimental deletion of the Sod1 gene in oocytes, resulted in increased oxidative stress and triggered ferroptosis within PFs. In conclusion, this study identified antioxidant defense mechanisms protecting PFs in mouse ovaries and characterized cell death mechanisms of oxidative stress-induced PF death.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is the main cause of infertility in women. Some cases of POI are thought to be caused by genetic defects and the clinical outcomes of these patients are unknown. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of the peripheral blood of a cohort of 55 subjects with POI and identified one heterozygous missense variant in FOXL2 (c.1045G>C; p.Arg349Gly) and two heterozygous missense variants in ERCC6 (c.379G>A; p.Val127Ile and c.4223A>C; p.Glu1408 Ala) in four POI patients. All of these heterozygous mutations were predicted to be deleterious and were parentally inherited from their heterozygous fathers. The mRNA and protein expression of FOXL2 and ERCC6 were absent or decreased in the patients. The patients carrying the variants of FOXL2 (c.1045G>C; p.Arg349Gly) and ERCC6 (c.379G>A; p.Val127Ile) failed to conceive in two and four assisted reproductive cycles, respectively. Another patient and her sister carrying the ERCC6 (c.4223A>C; p.Glu1408 Ala) variant achieved good clinical outcomes after assisted reproductive therapy. Our findings support the possible roles of FOXL2 and ERCC6 in POI and might contribute to the genetic counseling of POI patients.\n",

            "标题: Prevalence of the FMR1 Gene Premutation in Young Women with a Diminished Ovarian Reserve Included in an IVF Program: Implications for Clinical Practice.\n",
            "摘要: The relationship between premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and premutation in the FMR1 gene is well established. In recent years, though, a potential relationship between the latter and a low ovarian reserve has been suggested. To explore it, we conducted a retrospective study in an IVF program at a university tertiary referral center in Barcelona (Spain). Data were obtained retrospectively from a total of 385 women referred for FMR1 gene testing at our institution from January 2018 to December 2021. We compared the prevalence of FMR1 gene premutation between 93 of them, younger than 35 years, with a diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), characterized by levels of anti-Mullerian hormone < 1.1 ng/mL and antral follicle count < 5; and 132 egg donors screened by protocol that served as the controls. We found a higher prevalence of FMR1 premutation in the DOR group (seven patients (7.69%)) than in the control group (one patient (1.32%)), Fisher-exact test p-value = 0.012). We concluded that compared with the general population represented by young egg donors, the prevalence of FMR1 gene premutation is higher in young patients with a diminished ovarian reserve. Although these findings warrant further prospective validation in a larger cohort of patients within DOR, they suggest that, in clinical practice, FMR1 premutation should be determined in infertile young patients with DOR in order to give them adequate genetic counselling.\n",

            "摘要: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as the depletion of ovarian function before the age of 40 years. The global prevalence of POI is 3.5%. To date, genetic factors account for 23.5% of the etiology of POI. Herein, a previously uncharacterized pathogenic homozygous variant of the chromosome segregation-1-like gene (CSE1L) was identified in POI patients via targeted panel sequencing. It is reported that dysregulated iron metabolism is involved in many reproductive endocrine disorders; however, its precise role in POI remains obscure. In this study, we identified CSE1L as a potential candidate gene that plays an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis. Deficiency of CSE1L led to ferroptosis in human granulosa cells, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Mechanistically, coimmunoprecipitation identified the direct interaction between CSE1L and FoxO1. Inhibition of CSE1L led to the excessive accumulation of FoxO1 in the nucleus via nucleocytoplasmic transport. Then, FoxO1 bound to the promoter region of NCOA4 and promoted its transcription, which was verified by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, inhibition of CSE1L in cumulus cell monolayer could impede oocyte maturation, which might be associated with oxidative stress. Consequently, our study first revealed that CSE1L participated in ferroptosis in human ovarian granulosa cells via nucleocytoplasmic transportation, which might be helpful in revealing the molecular mechanism of CSE1L in the development of POI. Importantly, these findings might provide new insights into the application of ferroptosis inhibitors in the treatment of POI.\n",

            "摘要: BACKGROUND/AIM: The tumor suppressor CDKN2C (also designed as p18(INK4C) or p18) is deleted in approximately 7% to 40% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, indicative of its potential association with myeloma pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quantitative real-time PCR-based assay was developed to determine p18 deletion in DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a cohort of 108 multiple myeloma patients after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Additionally, the p18 mRNA expression level in PBMCs was quantitatively assessed using Taqman((R)) gene expression assays. RESULTS: p18 was homozygously and hemizygously deleted in PBMCs from 3 (2.8%) and 5 (4.6%) patients, respectively. Neither the p18 deletion nor the p18 mRNA levels in PBMCs were associated with progression-free survival (PFS), 90-day response, and the occurrence of severe mucositis in these patients (all p-values >0.20). CONCLUSION: Neither p18 deletion nor p18 mRNA expression in PBMCs can be used as a prognostic biomarker in MM patients.\n",

Here through GWAS meta-analysis under the recessive model of 174,329 postmenopausal women from Iceland, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK; UK Biobank) and Norway, we study low-frequency variants with a large effect on AOM. We discovered that women homozygous for the stop-gain variant rs117316434 (A) in CCDC201 (p.(Arg162Ter), minor allele frequency ~1%) reached menopause 9 years earlier than other women (P = 1.3 x 10(-15)). The genotype is present in one in 10,000 northern European women and leads to primary ovarian insufficiency in close to half of them. Consequently, homozygotes have fewer children, and the age at last childbirth is 5 years earlier (P = 3.8 x 10(-5)). The CCDC201 gene was only found in humans in 2022 and is highly expressed in oocytes. Homozygosity for CCDC201 loss-of-function has a substantial impact on female reproductive health, and homozygotes would benefit from reproductive counseling and treatment for symptoms of early menopause.\n",

            "标题: Oocyte-specific deletion of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 causes apoptosis of mouse oocytes within the early-growing follicles by mitochondrial fission defect-reactive oxygen species-DNA damage.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: Mutations in several translation initiation factors are closely associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), but the underlying pathogenesis remains largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (Eif5) conditional knockout mice aiming to investigate the function of eIF5 during oocyte growth and follicle development. Here, we demonstrated that Eif5 deletion in mouse primordial and growing oocytes both resulted in the apoptosis of oocytes within the early-growing follicles. Further studies revealed that Eif5 deletion in oocytes downregulated the levels of mitochondrial fission-related proteins (p-DRP1, FIS1, MFF and MTFR) and upregulated the levels of the integrated stress response-related proteins (AARS1, SHMT2 and SLC7A1) and genes (Atf4, Ddit3 and Fgf21). Consistent with this, Eif5 deletion in oocytes resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by elongated form, aggregated distribution beneath the oocyte membrane, decreased adenosine triphosphate content and mtDNA copy numbers, and excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Meanwhile, Eif5 deletion in oocytes led to a significant increase in the levels of DNA damage response proteins (gammaH2AX, p-CHK2 and p-p53) and proapoptotic proteins (PUMA and BAX), as well as a significant decrease in the levels of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Eif5 deletion in mouse oocytes results in the apoptosis of oocytes within the early-growing follicles via mitochondrial fission defects, excessive ROS accumulation and DNA damage. This study provides new insights into pathogenesis, genetic diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets for POI. KEY POINTS: Eif5 deletion in oocytes leads to arrest in oocyte growth and follicle development. Eif5 deletion in oocytes impairs the translation of mitochondrial fission-related proteins, followed by mitochondrial dysfunction. Depletion of Eif5 causes oocyte apoptosis via ROS accumulation and DNA damage response pathway.\n",

            "摘要: Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) is a highly heterogeneous condition characterized by ovarian dysfunction in women occurring before the age of 40, representing a significant cause of female infertility. It manifests through primary or secondary amenorrhea. While more than half of POI cases are idiopathic, genetic factors play a pivotal role in all instances with known causes, contributing to approximately 20-25% of cases. This article comprehensively reviews the genetic factors associated with POI, delineating the primary candidate genes. The discussion delves into the intricate relationship between these genes and ovarian development, elucidating the functional consequences of diverse mutations to underscore the fundamental impact of genetic effects on POI. The identified genetic factors, encompassing gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, are systematically classified based on whether the resulting POI is syndromic or non-syndromic. Furthermore, this paper explores the genetic interplay between mitochondrial genes, such as Required for Meiotic Nuclear Division 1 homolog Gene (RMND1), Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S22 Gene (MRPS22), Leucine-rich Pentapeptide Repeat Gene (LRPPRC), and non-coding RNAs, including both microRNAs and Long non-coding RNAs, with POI. The insights provided serve to consolidate and enhance our understanding of the etiology of POI, contributing to establishing a theoretical foundation for diagnosing and treating POI patients, as well as for exploring the mechanisms underlying the disease.\n",

            "标题: Conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes causes reduced litter size, ovarian reserve depletion and impaired oocyte in vitro maturation with advanced reproductive age in mice.\n",
            "摘要: BACKGROUND: An estimated 1 in 350 women carry germline BRCA1/2 mutations, which confer an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and may also contribute to subfertility. All mature, sex steroid-producing ovarian follicles are drawn from the pool of non-renewable primordial follicles, termed the 'ovarian reserve'. The clinical implications of early ovarian reserve exhaustion extend beyond infertility, to include the long-term adverse health consequences of loss of endocrine function and premature menopause. We aimed to determine whether conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes impacts ovarian follicle numbers, oocyte quality and fertility in mice with advancing maternal age. We also aimed to determine the utility of AMH as a marker of ovarian function, by assessing circulating AMH levels in mice and women with BRCA1/2 mutations, and correlating this with ovarian follicle counts. METHODS: In this study, we addressed a longstanding question in the field regarding the functional consequences of BRCA1 inactivation in oocytes. To recapitulate loss of BRCA1 protein function in oocytes, we generated mice with conditional gene deletion of Brca1 in oocytes using Gdf9-Cre recombinase (WT: Brca1(fl/fl)Gdf9(+/+); cKO: Brca1(fl/fl)Gdf9(cre/+)). FINDINGS: While the length of the fertile lifespan was not altered between groups after a comprehensive breeding trial, conditional loss of Brca1 in oocytes led to reduced litter size in female mice. Brca1 cKO animals had a reduced ovarian reserve and oocyte maturation was impaired with advanced maternal age at postnatal day (PN)300, compared to WT animals. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations (the gold-standard indirect marker of the ovarian reserve used in clinical practice) were not predictive of reduced primordial follicle number in Brca1 cKO mice versus WT. Furthermore, we found no correlation between follicle number or density and serum AMH concentrations in matched samples from a small cohort of premenopausal women with BRCA1/2 mutations. INTERPRETATION: Together, our data demonstrate that BRCA1 is a key regulator of oocyte number and quality in females and suggest that caution should be used in relying on AMH as a reliable marker of the ovarian reserve in this context.
